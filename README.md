# Gambling simulator
Try a fun and relaxing game! What could go wrong?

# What is this project?
This is a text-based RPG that I am writing as an exercise to improve my python skills, especially object-oriented programming. It started out as a project prompt on Codecademy. I was trying to write a very small script to simulate a coin toss game. I kept adding features and then realized I wanted to add a story, which lead to more features. I hope to learn more about all aspects of software development, from the actual coding to the distribution to end users. I am also taking the opportunity to learn more about how to use Github.

# What does it do?
16 June 2021: This is a script which will allow the user to play a coin toss game. It will keep track of the coins, wins and losses, and the results of the coin toss. I am working on adding more as mentioned above.

28 June 2021: The coing game is now complete. At the end stage, if the correct dialog choice is selected, the RPG character creation will start.

# How to install it?
Eventually, the player will not need to install this, it will be web-based.

#How to play?
This will be a text-based game that users will play through ttheir web browser.

# License
Currently, I have not put a license on this project because I am not sure where it's going.
